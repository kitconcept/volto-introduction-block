## Introduction

A standalone (detached slate) block that provides a text block meant to be used as introduction to a content page. This text usually having special formatting. It allows different paragraphs using breaklines (ENTER). It does not allow certain styling (as headings).

## Block configuration

### `unwantedButtons`

It allows you to specify which buttons from the current slate block toolbar should be removed from the introduction block.
The default is to remove the buttons for any heading and the blockquote.

You can configure them using this setting.
This custom configuration will remove the `h3` and `blockquote`.:


```js
  config.blocks.blocksConfig.introduction = {
    ...config.blocks.blocksConfig.introduction,
    unwantedButtons: ['heading-three', 'blockquote'],
  };
```

## Installation

To install your project, you must choose the method appropriate to your version of Volto.


### Volto 17 and earlier

Create a new Volto project (you can skip this step if you already have one):

```
npm install -g yo @plone/generator-volto
yo @plone/volto my-volto-project --addon @kitconcept/volto-introduction-block
cd my-volto-project
```

Add `@kitconcept/volto-introduction-block` to your package.json:

```JSON
"addons": [
    "@kitconcept/volto-introduction-block"
],

"dependencies": {
    "@kitconcept/volto-introduction-block": "*"
}
```

Download and install the new add-on by running:

```
yarn install
```

Start volto with:

```
yarn start
```

### Volto 18 and later

Add `@kitconcept/volto-introduction-block` to your `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@kitconcept/volto-introduction-block": "*"
}
```

Add `@kitconcept/volto-introduction-block` to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const addons = ['@kitconcept/volto-introduction-block'];
```

If this package provides a Volto theme, and you want to activate it, then add the following to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const theme = '@kitconcept/volto-introduction-block';
```
